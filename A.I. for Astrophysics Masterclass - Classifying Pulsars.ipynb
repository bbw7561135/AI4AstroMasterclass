In doing this you’ll begin to understand how A.I. can be applied in the real-world. You’ll also become comfortable building your own basic machine learning workflows in Python. You may even pick up some astrophysics knowledge along the way, which I hope you'll find interesting.

Although CPUs are complex devices, we can think of them as simple input/output boxes. They accept input in the form of machine code and produce machine code outputs. To control the CPU, the code you write must be turned into “Machine Code”.  The CPU reads the machine code, and ultimately does as it’s told!

This file is then passed to the interpreter. The interpreter goes through the code file line by line and translates it to machine code. This produces an executable file, that a CPU can run. Some interpreted languages are special, in that they can be interpreted on the fly. That is, you don’t need to interpret an entire source code file to create machine code.  You can interpret single lines of code as you write them if needed. Languages like ```Python``` and ```Ruby``` are interpreted.

To help us do this there is a set of standards, some might say guidelines, for writing “good” Python code. The standard was created when a Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) was approved. PEP 8 defined coding standards which I strongly encourage you to adopt. The code we write here will adhere to this standard as closely as possible – but if you’re ever in doubt about coding styles or conventions – check [the standard](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).\n",

    "As we continue to become an increasingly technological society, we accumulate ever growing quantities of data. This data often contains useful insights and knowledge that can be used to improve society. Yet it is impossible for human beings to interpret manually, as this would take a prohibitively long time. Machine learning has the potential to alleviate and solve such problems. This explains why it has grown in importance in recent years in domains such as medicine, physics, climate modelling, finance etc. This trend is almost certain to continue moving forward. However, machine learning is not only being used to reveal hidden knowledge in data. It is also used to automate many onerous tasks, and in some controversial cases, automate tasks traditionally undertaken by people, to reduce labour costs/increase profit. It is hard to not exaggerate the crucial role (for better or worse) that machine learning is currently playing in our society. Whether or not you're interested in how works, it will be there in the background - making decision that impact your daily life. It is therefore important that those of us applying ML understand its strengths, weaknesses, and the ethical implications of its applications.\n",

An oracle could be a parent, teacher, sibling, friend, book, or an online resource such as this. The oracle provides a source of information that we process, store in memory, and utilize when required. Our memory is capable of storing a lifetime of knowledge and experience, making it a highly sophisticated analogue of a computer hard drive. Though we store information differently to computer hard drives, the content is the same in both cases – data. \n",

Over time we collect experiences. Eventually we connect our experiences and the information given to us, with some tangible outcome or label. So, for example, most babies learn automatically that when they cry, then can get parental attention. Ultimately, we learn to use our experiences to make decisions or take actions. Yet given the same information, it is possible that two people will take very different actions. This is because knowledge and experience differ from person to person.  In other words, the content of our memory datasets is different. Despite any differences between us, human decision making is geared toward making the best, or “optimal” decisions using past experience and available information.\n",

Therefore, we don’t know what a mammal is, or what a bird is. Nonetheless, we’re again asked to correctly assign a set of unknown animals to their correct class group – either mammals or birds. To solve this problem, we can use the inherent structure of the data, to self-separate it into groups. For instance, most mammals are larger than birds.  Thus, mammals generally have higher mass. This means we can separate on a feature like mass in this instance. However, that feature may not work, if all the unknown mammals are field mice, and all the unknown birds are Ostriches or Emus. Unsupervised learning is possible when we have unlabeled datasets.\n",

If one bit is represented by a single 0 or 1, then each synapse can store roughly this much information: 00000. Consider that there are 1,000 trillion synapses in the average human brain.

It is incomplete for many reasons. For instance, our local library doesn’t contain every book ever written on a subject.

Finally, there is the knowledge we ultimately use to make a decision. This is represented by the circle labelled 4. This is a subset of the knowledge we possess. For example, when trying to classify unknown animals as either birds or mammals, we don’t need to use our knowledge of insects.\n",

Emotions and personal [bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases) influence our interpretation of available information, which in turn impacts our decision making. Let’s consider 1 more example. Over thousands of years the human race has conducted countless scientific experiments showing the Earth is round. We’ve collated mounds of information related to our planet, it’s properties, and its place in the solar system.  Yet there are [groups of people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_flat_Earth_societies) who reject this information due to their personal biases and how they interpret the world around them.

This is because Machine Learning is concerned with making optimal decisions primarily using the tools of statistics.\n",

Much like in humans, where experiences are associated with outcomes, the input features are associated with some outcome or label. This is represented by the set $E$. To make decisions and predictions using this information, machine learning uses statistics. This type of mathematical decision making uses only the evidence available.  You may think that this makes automated learning immune to bias. This is unfortunately not the case. Machine learning can be just as fallible for two main reasons.\n",

    "1. The first reason automated decision making can be flawed - biased input data. For example, suppose you want to teach an algorithm to recognize a specific disease in a group of patients. You provide the algorithm with data, which just so happens to describe patients aged between 60 to 80. You then run the algorithm on patients aged 18 to 30. The algorithm performs badly, as its knowledge is biased toward recognizing disease in much older patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The second reason is biases in the cognitive process. For instance, suppose we try to teach an algorithm to predict when a train on the Tokyo rail network will be late. Trains on this network are exceptionally punctual. To achieve the best overall performance, just never predict that a train will be late.\n",

Whilst a human can look at an animal and automatically assess its mass (approximately), we must give the artificial system the mass value directly. But how is this information used? In humans, you can scan your experience and consider examples of animals with similar masses, to an unknown animal currently in front of you.  Artificial systems instead compare the mass value against a numerical distribution (stored in $E$) describing the mass values for all the animals previously observed.

We desire features with high information content that help with class separation.

    "Let’s summarise the main phases involved in the application of machine learning. First, we collect our data. This step may require data normalization, data cleaning, data labelling, or even removing personal details according to ethics requirements. Whatever the exact steps are, we should end up with a dataset ready for learning. There should be enough samples in the data set to enable it to be split into disjoint training, and test sets. The data should be representative of the concepts we’re trying to learn, and we should aim to minimize the potential for bias where possible.\n",

    "After you’ve designed the features, you must extract them from the dataset, and evaluate them. You can [evaluate features](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_selection.html) by quantifying their information content. Some features have higher information content than others, whilst a subset features may reveal previously hidden information when combined with seemingly unrelated features. In both cases it’s good to evaluate the features to discover these relationships.\n",

    "Once the features have been evaluated, you can use them to start exploring which machine learning methods work best for your problem. It is desirable to try different types of learning models, evaluating their performance. Choose a model, and train it. Evaluate the trained model on separate test data set - ensure the performance is still good. If it isn’t, try a different algorithm. Repeat this exploration phase until performance is satisfactory. When satisfied that the machine learning model works well, then you can finally deploy it upon new data.\n",

This makes them incredibly dense objects. So dense in fact, that a spoonful of Neutron star material would weigh as much as Mount Everest. This density gives Neutron stars large and powerful gravitational fields. They also posses strong magnetic fields. Together these characteristics conspire to make the locality surrounding Neutron Stars one of the most extreme environments in the known Universe. The image below provides a clearer view of the Neutron Star at the centre of the Crab Nebula, shown in the first image.

These rare Neutron Stars are known more generally as [Radio Pulsars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsar). Radio pulsars are incredibly important. This is because we can use their radio emission to probe the space between the Earth and the Pulsar (the [Interstellar medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_medium), as well as the pulsars local environment. This is possible as we can detect changes in their radio emission caused by gravitational and magnetic fields, interstellar dust and many other things. This makes Pulsars incredible natural laboratories. Scientists rely upon them test many scientific theories, such as [theories of gravitation]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity#General_relativity\n",
    ") . We simply can't build labs on Earth that can test these theories properly. This places great emphasis on finding pulsars. The image below shows the idealised model of the standard radio pulsar which we explore below. \n",

    "Pulsars are very rapidly spinning objects. As they rotate, they emit radio waves from their magnetic poles. If their magnetic axis does not align with their rotational axis, then as the pulsar rotates, radio emission is swept across the sky. Much like a lighthouse warning light.

    "Pulsars can rotate extremely quickly - up to 716 times per second. This means their pulses can arrive in quick succession. To detect these rapid pulsations, we need sensitive equipment capable of sampling radio emission at very fine timescales (microsecond time sampling needed). To make matters worse, no two pulsars produce the same pulse shape when viewed from Earth. Pulse shape is a little like a fingerprint. Some astronomers can identify pulsars just from their pulse shape! Two example pulses are shown below for the pulsars [PSR J0407+1607](http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=PSR%20J0407%2B1607) and [J0437+4715](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSR_J0437%E2%88%924715).

However, our telescopes also pickup lots of other sources of radio emission. This might include radio interference from other stars, mainly our Sun, or interference from technology here on Earth (satellites, mobile phones, microwaves). These signals are very \"loud\" compared to the emission produce by pulsars. Thus, finding pulsars amongst all the [noise]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_(electronics)) and [interference]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_interference) is a bit like trying to hear a pin drop at a heavy metal concert. \n",

Unfortunately, this comes at a cost. We capture many signals that may originate from pulsars, but equally may originate from sources of interference or even background noise. We call such detections **“Candidates”**. The only way to be sure of the true of origin of a candidate signal is to check them manually. This would require pointing a telescope at each candidate source location and checking if a signal is present. This is too time consuming and costly to do in practice. Instead each candidate must be checked systematically – either by an astronomer or piece of software. Usually candidates are filtered by software, and the most promising are checked by astronomers.

This measure describes how much a pulsar signal has been [affected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispersion_(optics)#Pulsar_emissions) by travel through the Interstellar medium, allowing us to estimate its distance from Earth (roughly). Persistence of the pulsar signal throughout time is shown in plot c). Pulsar signals should be persistent over time, producing this black line. Sometimes Pulsars do \"turn off\" their radio emission, or even skip emission for some number of rotations. Pulsar emission maybe also disappear because their signals become blocked by an object in their path (an eclipse). Though in general their signals are persistent in time.

A simple way of normalising data involves altering it, so it has a [mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean) (average) of zero, and unit [variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance) (a variance exactly equal to 1). Remember, the mean is simply a statistic used to measure the average value of the data. Whilst variance is another metric we can use to measure how spread out the data is. So, data with a mean of 1 and a variance of 0.01, would be tightly clustered around the value of 1. Whilst data with a mean of 1 and a variance of 10 will be much more spread out. We can use code from numpy library to make this normalisation process easy. Later we can write our own methods to do this.\n",

    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "For those that are interested, the type of normalisation we doing here is also known as the [standard score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score) and Z-score normalisation. It uses a simple formula to alter the data. This is as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "$z = \\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma}$\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "This basically tells us that the standard score $z$, is equal to the value $x$ minus the mean of the data ($\\mu$, called \"mu\"), divided by the standard deviation of the data ($\\sigma$, called \"sigma\"). If we have the following data,\n",

This survey was undertaken at the [Parkes radio telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkes_Observatory). The data is comprised of $1,586$ pulsar and $8,852$ non-pulsar pulse profiles. Each profile has exactly 128 numerical phase bins (and array of 128 values).

These values are derivable from theory, and are known to be correct. We can test our function works well, by comparing the values it computes for such a Gaussian distribution. However, I don't have the data points describing a perfect Gaussian distribution readily at hand! So to perform such a test, I use a simple trick. I instead use a Gaussian random number generator, to generate an approximately perfect distribution. I can then compare the outputs of my function computed over this distribution, to the expected values from theory. Whilst the results will not match exactly, it should give us an indication of how the function is performing.\n",

    "The final activity is to go completely **rogue** all on your own. Copy the code from above - use it to build and test your own classifier. Preferably but not one of those already used. This is going to require you to do some work. Head over to the [scikit-learn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html), and search for new methods that you could apply. Try them out, extract new features, change the evaluation procedure - it's all up to you. Proceed as you see fit. I'll be around in the masterclass to help and guide you. Some might find that certain methods work better than others on this data, and that's ok. This isn't a competition. We're aiming to learn about new methods, and we can learn as much from failure and success. I’ll give you a hint for something interesting to try – why not have a got at training a neural network. Scikit-learn contains a network called a [Multi-layer Perceptron]( https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neural_networks_supervised.html) which will prove useful.\n"
